        <h2>About This Database</h2>
        <p>
          The aim of this website is to allow consumers to make informed choices
          about the products they choose to buy by highlighting ethical
          considerations in the course of the search for a product, rather than
          as difficult research.
        </p>
        <p>
          This database is compiled through the collection of multiple publicly
          available sources of data and uses a web crawler to try to keep up to
          date and provide the most accurate information possible.

      <section id="feature">
        <h2>I want to feature my product here</h2>
